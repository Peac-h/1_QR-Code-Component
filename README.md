# Project 1 - Frontend Mentor Challenge - QR code component

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

This QR code component is one of the easy challenges, intended for newbie coders and this is **my very first project** to build on my own.

The only difference between the solution and given references is the media query part. No single media query was necessary, but I added few, as I had the knowledge already.
